			localPath:		Required. Local path of the file to deploy. Relative to the current project. Value should not start with '\'.

							same folder as the source file, and will infer its name base on the item type. 
							
							For TypeScript files, Visual Studio's options to combine output files into one single file, or to redirect output files to
